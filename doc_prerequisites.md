## What do I need to Play?

To play Coindroids you need a Coindroids account, a defcoin wallet, and some defcoin to play with. You also need to be functional human or human-type android; other lifeforms may not be supported.

## Choosing a Wallet

### Defcoin-QT _(Linux/OSX/Windows)_

If you're playing with a laptop or desktop Defcoin-QT is the way to go. You can get it directly from the DEFCOIN website defcoin.org.

Coindroids only processes actions that originate from addresses that are registered. For this reason, if your defcoin wallet uses change addresses, such as Defcoin-QT, you will have to do a bit more work to play successfully.

For example, if you have 100 DFC in one address and send 0.01 DFC to play Coindroids, 99.99 DFC will be moved to a completely different address. You will still own the 99.99 DFC however because it resides in a different address, it cannot be used to play Coindroids.

In order to resolve this, you can send the coins to your registered address and continue playing from there.

A workaround is to enable Coin Control in your client via the Preferences page. This will allow you to choose which coins to spend in your wallet and where to forward change from your transaction. As long as you forward change to your Coindroids address, it will work fine.

Here are some more detailed instructions on configuring Coin Control once you've downloaded the Defcoin-QT wallet.

1. Go to Settings > Options
2. Click on the Display tab
3. Check the check box labelled Display coin control features (experts only!)
4. Close the pop-up, now when you go the Send tab you should see Coin Control Features
5. From there you can check off custom change address and enter the defcoin address that you registered on Coindroids or plan on registering with
6. Play Coindroids

### Beerwallet _(iOS)_

The first standalone iOS defcoin wallet, recently approved and now available on iTunes. For more information check out beerwallet.org.

## Registration

* Click Sign Up
* Enter your email address (used only for password resets) and choose a username and password
* Click the "Sign Up" button and you will be automatically logged in with the account you just created
* Once you've signed up you'll see a register address page. Send one token (0.01 DFC) to this address and wait for it to be included in a block on the Defcoin blockchain. This should normally take less than 5 minutes, but it could take longer.

Keep your payout address' private key safe!
