# Items

If you need to become a more effective killing machine, you can buy items to augment your abilities. New weapons can increase your attacks with a multiplier (so you can deal the same damage by sending 0.0002 instead of sending 0.0004!), or increase your droid's defensive abilities with a multiplier (so enemies need to send more coins to deal the same amount of damage against you). 

As a droid levels up, new items become available that can be purchased by the player to equip on their droid, or to use immediately. Each item has specific advantages and will alter different aspects of the droid. 


## Item Types

|   Type | Description  |  
|------------------|----|
|Weapon| A droids main weaponry. |
|Shield| Like Armour it also reduces the amount of incoming damage. Some shields also provide additional benefits.|
|Consumable| Items are held in the droid's inventory until they are removed, expired or broken.  |
|Set| A set of items, usually either a full model or collection of goods |
|Head| A droid head. Usually found on most droids|
|Torso| A key part of any droid. Equip scope requirements will be based off the characteristics of this part|
|Arm| An arm, sometimes droids have a couple of these|
|Leg| A leg, sometimes droids have a couple of these|
|Material| Usually found after clobbering an enemy, different materials will help you forge new items|

## Equip Scopes

|Name | Descirption|
|----|------|
|Inventory|Can only be placed in your droids inventory, to be consumed during the processing of the round |
|Class |The class of the item must match the class of the Torso being used | 
|Global|Just go ahead and equip this onto whatever body part you want, as long as the body part supports the addition|
|Character| The item must match the character of the Torso being used |

## Drop Scopes

Some items drop and some don't. You usually won't have to worry about an arm falling off of your own droid, but it's good to keep an eye out for weak NPCs or droids built of your favourite material.

|Name| Description|
|----|----|
|Drone|This item has the possibility to drop if the droid is an NPC only. |
|Never| This type of items will never drop| 
|Always| This item may drop from anybody if the right conditions are met.|


## Purchasing

To purchase any item, simply find the Item Address in the Item Directory and send the cost to that address from your registered wallet. Attempting to purchase an item that requires a higher level droid, or not including enough funds to cover the cost of the item will result in the funds being returned (minus a network transaction fee).


## Forging

Instead of purchasing a new item, if you have all the right materials and items, you can choose to forge it. Forging works a lot like purchasing.
