# Items

If you need to become a more effective killing machine, you can buy items to augment your abilities. New weapons can increase your attacks with a multiplier (so you can deal the same damage by sending 0.0002 instead of sending 0.0004!), or increase your droid's defensive abilities with a multiplier (so enemies need to send more coins to deal the same amount of damage against you). 

As a droid levels up, new items become available that can be purchased by the player to equip on their droid, or to use immediately. Each item has specific advantages and will alter different aspects of the droid. 


## Item Types

|   Type | Description  |  
|------------------|----|
|Weapon| A droids main weaponry. |
|Shield| Like Armour it also reduces the amount of incoming damage. Some shields also provide additional benefits.|
|Consumable| Items are held in the droid's inventory until they are removed, expired or broken.  |
|Set| A set of items, usually either a full model or collection of goods |
|Head| A droid head. Usually found on most droids|
|Torso| A key part of any droid. Equip scope requirements will be based off the characteristics of this part|
|Arm| An arm, sometimes droids have a couple of these|
|Leg| A leg, sometimes droids have a couple of these|
|Material| Usually found after clobbering an enemy, different materials will help you forge new items|

## Equipping Items

Not all items can be fit to one another and merged into a droid build. There are a number of attributes that determine exactly how items can be used together including the Equip Scope, Equip Required and Requip Option fields. 

### Equip Scopes

|Name | Descirption|
|----|------|
|Inventory|Can only be placed in your droids inventory, to be consumed during the processing of the round |
|Class |The class of the item must match the class of the Torso being used | 
|Global|Just go ahead and equip this onto whatever body part you want, as long as the body part supports the addition|
|Character| The item must match the character of the Torso being used |

### Equip Required & Equip Optional 

When building your droid, first you start with a Torso and work from there. Torsos will have a number of requirements, as well as some optional slots. 

|      model       |           Equip Required            |  Equip Optional  |
|------------------+---------------------------------+------------|
| Assault Training | Arm,Arm,Leg,Leg,Head,Weapon | Shield |
| Tank Training    | Arm,Arm,Leg,Head,Weapon     | Shield |
| Scout Training   | Arm,Arm,Leg,Leg,Head,Weapon | Shield |
 
Here we can see that the Tank model only requires one leg, while the Scout and Assault Models require two. All Torsos available at the start can equip a shield, but it's not required. 

<aside class='notice'>
These slots build upon eachother as well. If the Head you choose to equip to your Torso as an optional Hat, adding a Hat to the build would be acceptable. 
</aside>

## Material Drops

Material drops happen fairly freuquently and do not require the droid to be killed in the attack. These materials can be used to forge new items so it's good to keep an eye out for weak NPCs or droids built of your favourite material. 

### Composition 

Weaponry, Shields, and Chassis parts each have a specific set of materials that make-up their composition. 

The Assault Training Torso is made up of:

| Material | Content | 
|----------|---------|
|Silicon   | 6%  |
|Iron 	   | 4%  |
|Aluminum  | 24% | 
|Copper    | 4%  |
|Germanium | 2%  |

<aside class='notice'>
One can never be completely sure of the make-up of a droid so those numbers won't add to 100%
</aside>

When attacking a droid, if EMI + EMS / composition * time of day + 7 = droid happy fun material great. 
TODO^ add real information


## Item Drops

Some items drop and some don't. You usually won't have to worry about an arm falling off of your own droid, but keep an eye out for NPCs sporting some shiney loose looking swag. 

### Drop Scopes

|Name| Description|
|----|----|
|Drone|This item has the possibility to drop if the droid is an NPC only. |
|Never| This type of items will never drop| 
|Always| This item may drop from anybody if the right conditions are met.|

### Drop Frequency



## Purchasing

To purchase any item, simply find the Item Address in the Item Directory and send the cost to that address from your registered wallet. Attempting to purchase an item that requires a higher level droid, or not including enough funds to cover the cost of the item will result in the funds being returned (minus a network transaction fee).


## Forging

Instead of purchasing a new item, if you have all the right materials and items, you can choose to forge it. Forging works a lot like purchasing.

|---|----|
|Space crap| 7|
|Space gold| 1|
