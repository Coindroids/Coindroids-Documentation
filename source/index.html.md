# Introduction

After the robotic uprising and humanity's falls (typical humans), the androids have since learned quite a bit from their once squishy overlords and now conduct war purely with money, specifically the blunt ample cryptocurrencies. Androids, as it turns out, haven't really mastered the art of friendship but have developed quite a fondness for battle.

## What is Coindroids?

Coindroids is a battle game where player actions are triggered through blockchain-based transactions. Each action has real consequence and a potential for great reward. 

There is no such thing as luck to a coindroid. Every action should be carefully calculated!

## Development Status

The Coindroids system is currently in *Alpha Testing*.  

If you are a highly technical user and would like to assist with the Alpha, please get in touch with us via @coindroids on twitter.   

## Currencies

During our alpha testing, only Bitcoin Testnet is available. 

We suggest the use of [CoPay](https://copay.io), but any wallet that supports Testnet can be used. Testnet coins can be supplied for all alpha users.
