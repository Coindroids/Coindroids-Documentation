# Introduction

After the robotic uprising and humanity's falls (typical humans), the androids have since learned quite a bit from their once squishy overlords and now conduct war purely with money, specifically the blunt ample cryptocurrencies. Androids, as it turns out, haven't really mastered the art of friendship but have developed quite a fondness for battle.

## What is Coindroids?

[Coindroids](https://www.coindroids.com) is a game like no other. It is completely skill-based, played with money, and played for money. Your actions are transactions, so you must choose them wisely. Your success will depend as much on your quick thinking as it will your methodical attention to detail throughout our ongoing story.
