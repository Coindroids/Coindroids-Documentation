## What is Coindroids?

After the robotic uprising and humanity's falls (typical humans), the androids have since learned quite a bit from their once squishy overlords and now conduct war purely with money, specifically the blunt ample currencies Bitcoin & Defcoin. Androids, as it turns out, haven't really mastered the art of friendship but have developed quite a fondness for battle.

Coindroids is a robot based battle game played within a blockchain. If you're new to crypto currencies this is good way to get started.

## Development Status

The Coindroids system is currently in *Alpha Testing*.  

If you are a highly technical user and would like to assist with the Alpha, please get in touch with us via @coindroids on twitter.   

## Currencies

During our alpha testing, only Bitcoin Testnet is available. 

We suggest the use of [CoPay](https://copay.io), but any wallet that supports Testnet can be used. Testnet coins can be supplied for all alpha users.
