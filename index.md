## What is Coindroids?

After the robotic uprising and humanity's falls (typical humans), the androids have since learned quite a bit from their once squishy overlords and now conduct war purely with money, specifically the blunt ample currencies Bitcoin & Defcoin. Androids, as it turns out, haven't really mastered the art of friendship but have developed quite a fondness for battle.

Coindroids is a robot based battle game played within a blockchain. If you're new to crypto currencies this is good way to get started.

## Development Status

The Coindroids system is currently in *Alpha Testing*. We anticipate a move to beta by January 1st, 2016. 

If you are a highly technical user and would like to assist with the Alpha, please join us in #coindroids on freenode.
