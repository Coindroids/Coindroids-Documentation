## High Level Details 

Coindroids is a battle game where your objective is to attack and destroy other robots by blasting them with crypto currency. The game is played by sending defcoin to various defcoin addresses during a certain block. These transactions can be used to buy and equip items or to attack other players.

### Token

A "token" within Coindroids is 0.01 DFC.


Whenever you send any defcoin, make sure it is in multiples of 0.01DFC. Any additional coin is considered a donation to help keep the Coindroids servers running.

### Block


A "block" within Coindroids is one unit of time as measured by the Defcoin blockchain. Actions (i.e. transactions) that occur within the same block can be considered to all be occurring simultaneously.

## Attacking Other Players


* On the Find a Foe page you can search for players by name, or you can choose one of the randomly selected players shown on that page. If you are logged in, the Featured Players section will show you a selection of players that are the same level as you.

* If you are looking for more of challenge, the home page features bosses and our top players.

* The attack address of some bosses are hidden and can only be revealed by participating in other contests or challenges. You may want to pick a few locks, or have your hand at a crypto challenge.

* Some people (speakers, goons, humans) may be wearing their attack addresses on their person. Keep an eye out!

If an enemy droid's health is depleted by your attack, you've defeated that droid.

## Buying Items

If you need to become a more effective killing machine, you can buy items to augment your abilities. In Coindroids, you buy items by sending the required number of tokens to an item’s address. You can find item addresses by visiting the Unlocks page.

### Item types

#### Primary Weapons

Increase your attack damage.

#### Secondary Weapons

Increase your attack damage but to a lesser extent. If it was to the same extent, they would just be primary weapons.

#### Armour

Reduces the amount of incoming damage.

Some armour provides additional benefits such as the ability to automatically evade attacks or counter-attack.

#### Shield

Like Armour it also reduces the amount of incoming damage.

Some shields also provide additional benefits.

#### Item

These items are unique and typically have their effects limited for a certain number of blocks. For example, a repair kit may repair you in 1 block only, whereas an advanced repair kit can heal you 4 times over 4 blocks.

## Statistics

Droids have a number of attributes but these are the two key to understand. 

### Health

* Level 1 players have a maximum of 100 health points

* This limit increases as you level up.

* If your health reaches 0, you die and the contents of your purse are distributed to your attacker(s)

* Your droid will be repaired automatically and return to maximum health when the next Defcoin block is mined

* There are some items that can heal your droid before it dies if you’d rather not lose your purse!

### Purse

* Level 1 players can hold up to 100 tokens in their purse

* This limit increases as you level up.

* Players start the game with 0 tokens in their purse

* Tokens are added to your purse whenever you or your enemies buy items or attack each other

* When your purse is full, all tokens that can’t fit will be sent to your payout address immediately
