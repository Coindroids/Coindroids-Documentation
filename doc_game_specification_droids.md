Every player in the game is a Droid, a futuristic robot with many attributes. These attributes dictate how well they perform in a battle, be they attackers or defenders. They can also be purely cosmetic and simply make the character cool, hip and/or scary.

## Static Attributes

## Dynamic Attributes

|Name|Description|
|----|----|
|Energy| Even powerful Droids need a recharge now and then. Droids with low energy may not be able to run away and their attacks may have reduced strength|
|Focus|A Droid distracted by other processes and interfaces may not notice incoming attacks. Similarly, their shots may not be as accurate.|

These attributes are a bit more complicated than the others. They are dynamic, meaning they change regularly without user interaction, however they are also still deterministic. When taken into consideration by a player, these dynamic values allow for a much more strategic element of the Attack Process based on timing.

### Calculating Dynamic Attributes
Both of these values can each be calculated using the same algorithm. The value is unique per user and will change every time a new block of transactions is processed. The workflow to calculate these values is as follows:

## Leveling
As Droids gain experience, their level increases at certain targets. Leveling up allows a Droid to handle bigger and better upgrades and items.
At each level, the Droidâ€™s Purse Maximum and Health Maximum attributes both increase at steady rates.
