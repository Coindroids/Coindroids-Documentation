summary: "Understanding Items in the Coindroids universe"

---

As a droid levels up, new items become available that can be purchased by the player to equip on their droid, or to use immediately. Each item has specific advantages and will alter different aspects of the droid.
To purchase any item, simply find the Item Address in the Item Directory and send the cost to that address from your registered wallet.
Attempting to purchase an item that requires a higher level droid, or not including enough funds to cover the cost of the item will result in the funds being returned (minus a network transaction fee).

## Upgrades

Depending on the upgrade bring purchased, they may alter any of the Droid Chassis & Equipment Attributes (See Table 2).
Important: Upgrades that are performed will replace the portion of the droid body that is being altered.

Upgrades cannot be broken, lost or dropped.

## Actions
Action items may also alter a droid’s Chassis & Equipment Attributes (Table 2), as well as the droid’s Dynamic Attributes (Table 3). These items differ from upgrades as they are not permanent. They will take effect immediately and will last for a finite number of blocks.
A droid can only have 5 active items at a time.
