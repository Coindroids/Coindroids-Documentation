summary: "Understanding Items in the Coindroids universe"

---

As a droid levels up, new items become available that can be purchased by the player to equip on their droid, or to use immediately. Each item has specific advantages and will alter different aspects of the droid.
To purchase any item, simply find the Item Address in the Item Directory and send the cost to that address from your registered wallet.
Attempting to purchase an item that requires a higher level droid, or not including enough funds to cover the cost of the item will result in the funds being returned (minus a network transaction fee).

| Crank Cannon                             | Primary Weapon   |          | The developer of the spring shot decided to get the most out of their spring R&D and came up with this eclectic weapon. It fires a coin cannon ball using an extremely stiff string. There is a crank on the gun to compress the spring, at maximum spring compression it can pack quite a punch.           | 34700           | 29             | 49     | 71%      | 0       | 0%      | 0%             | 0%              | 0              | 5      | 0.50                  | 0%             | NPC        | Global      |

Yes, including robot hands. Instead it uses a silent ratcheting hand crack to set the draw string. This weapon is favoured by droid assassins as it's much quieter than a gun. | 27200           | 9              | 18     | 82%      | 0       | 0%      | 0%             | 0%              | 0              | 2      | 5.00                  | 0%             | NPC        | Global      |
